									<h3>Boudenib</h3>
									<p>Boudenib is close to the heart of North Star travel as both Driss and Younes were born and raised there.  It is a village of about 10,000 people near the Algerian border and about 1 hour south of Errachidia. Most people in Boudenib are nomads, farmers or serve in local businesses, but many job opportunities fell were lost when the Algerian border was closed and remains one of the least developed regions of Morocco.  In Boudenib there is a rich mix of cultures between Arabs and Berbers and is filled with warmth and hospitality.  It is our mission, through sustainable travel, to continue to support the development of the region.</p>
									<h3>Asociacion Taous</h3>
									<p>Asociacion began in 2015 as a partnership between local American Peace Corp volunteers and locals of Boudenib.  The Asociacion grew over time and now brings about 200 volunteers each year from Spain.  The goal of this partnership is for volunteers to develop a deep appreciation of our local culture through service.  We offer opportunities to paint and repair schools and community spaces, languages classes for children, and summer activities for children.</p>

									<h3 id="q1">What should I pack</h3>
										<p>Morocco is an Islamic country, but most tourist regions are comfortable with tourists donning a variety of standards of dress.  Your tour guide will always advise you when and where it is appropriate to keep your knees and shoulders covered and where you can feel free to wear shorts and tank tops.  As a general rule, the larger the city and the more touristy the region, the more comfortable you can be to wear clothing of your choice.  The more remote the area, the more modesty you can expect.  </p>
										<p>It is not necessary for you to wear a headscarf unless you are entering certain mosques or religious places of which your tour guide will advise you in advance. </p>
